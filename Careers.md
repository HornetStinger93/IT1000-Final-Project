## The Federal Bureau of Investigation 
![FBI Seal](/FBIseal.png)
 
 Why would I want to be a part of the FBI?
 * I have always wanted to work for the government and serve others. Early on I wanted to join the military like my Father, but I found out that I do not like being yelled at by people younger than me. I may come to find out that that is not exculsive to the military environment. Anyway, I really just want to help our country and its people and I feel the FBI allows that in the ways that I want to help. I do not like crime (who does?) and I especially detest rule breaking. I want to make this country safe and secure, but also free. Never sacrfice safety for freedom.
Here is a list of basic requeirements to apply for the [FBI Special Agent position](https://www.fbijobs.gov/career-paths/special-agents/eligibility): 
* Between 23 and 36 years of age
* Minimum Bachelor's Degree
* Pass PFT
* and some other stuff
## Work at a Church with Music and Worship
This does not really have a good general title I could think of but it works. Essentailly I would like to be in charge of planning sets for Worship services, writting music for the Church and working with students and others in the area of music. This really hasn't been a part of a career consideration until this semester. I really felt a push from God in this direction and [music](/Music.md) is my one of my favorite things next to food. This also goes back to serving people and being a part of something bigger than myself. Both this and the FBI fall into that category. I just really want to honor God in whatever I do, maybe this will work out.
