# **Welcome to my Careers page!!!!**
  This page will detail what I see myself doing with my life. **_Pro Tip:_** I have no idea. That's a bit disingenuous, but anyway here is my outlook.

## The Federal Bureau of Investigation 
![FBI Seal](/FBIseal.png)
 
 Why would I want to be a part of the FBI?
 * I have always wanted to work for the government and serve others. Early on I wanted to join the military like my Father, but I found out that I do not like being yelled at by people younger than me. I may come to find out that that is not exculsive to the military environment. Anyway, I really just want to help our country and its people and I feel the FBI allows that in the ways that I want to help. I do not like crime (who does?) and I especially detest rule breaking. I want to make this country safe and secure, but also free. Never sacrfice safety for freedom. One thing that goes against me working for the FBI is that I have a hard time spelling Bureau even after taking 4.5 years of french. 
Here is a list of basic requeirements to apply for the [FBI Special Agent position](https://www.fbijobs.gov/career-paths/special-agents/eligibility): 
* Between 23 and 36 years of age
* Minimum Bachelor's Degree
* Pass PFT
* and some other stuff
## Work at a Church with Music and Worship
![A Church](https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiamissourian.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/80/f80619fc-b96d-11ea-8a89-037a28b4382b/5ef8e2a7322f2.image.jpg?resize=1024%2C684)
>Leanne Tippett Mosby/ Missourian

This does not really have a good general title I could think of but it works. Essentailly I would like to be in charge of planning sets for Worship services, writting music for the Church and working with students and others in the area of music. This really hasn't been a part of a career consideration until this semester. I really felt a push from God in this direction and [music](/Music.md) is my one of my favorite things next to food. This also goes back to serving people and being a part of something bigger than myself. Both this and the FBI fall into that category. I just really want to honor God in whatever I do, maybe this will work out. 

### Here is some code
I am including code from one of my projects this year that sorta fits with the FBI theme and not at all with the Worship leader theme. It is from our positioning calculator in python. I had a fun time theming it!

print( "Welcome to my ICBM Position Calculator: sponsored by the US Government")

print( "This program is made possible by the tax paying public and users like you: Thank You!")

initial_position_of_missile = float(input("Enter the missile's initial position in meters: "))

initial_velocity_of_missile = float(input("Enter the missile's initial velocity in meters per second: "))

acceleration_of_missile = float(input("Enter the missile's accleration in meters per second squared: "))

flight_time = float(input("Enter the missile's estimated total flight time in seconds: "))

Missile_Final_Position = (initial_position_of_missile + initial_velocity_of_missile * flight_time + 0.5 * acceleration_of_missile * flight_time * flight_time) 

print ("Calculating...")

import time

time.sleep (3)

print ("Calculating...")

time.sleep (7)

if initial_position_of_missile == 0 or initial_velocity_of_missile == 0 or acceleration_of_missile == 0 or flight_time == 0 :
 print ("error")
    
else:

    print("The Missile's Final Position is:")
    
    time.sleep(1)
    
    print(str(Missile_Final_Position) + 'm')
    
    time.sleep(1)
    
    print("Hopefully you understand what this means in relation to your current position!")
    
    print( "Stay safe out there!")
    
    time.sleep(1)
    
    print("Product of The United States Government Â©2020")
    

Exit = input("Press ENTER to exit the program.")
