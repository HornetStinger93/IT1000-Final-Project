## The Federal Bureau of Investigation
 Why would I want to be a part of the FBI?
 * I have always wanted to work for the government and serve others. Early on I wanted to join the military like my Father, but I found out that I do not like being yelled at by people younger than me. I may come to find out that that is not exculsive to the military environment. Anyway, I really just want to help our country and its people and I feel the FBI allows that in the ways that I want to help. I do not like crime (who does?) and I especially detest rule breaking. I want to make this country safe and secure, but also free. Never sacrfice safety for freedom.
Here is a list of basic requeirements to apply for the FBI Special Agent position:
> * Between 23 and 36 years of age
* Minimum Bachelor's Degree
* Pass PFT
* and some other stuff
