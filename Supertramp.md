# SUPERTRAMP
I will now take this entire page and dedicate it to Supertramp, my [1b.](/music.md) favorite band. If you want to go home click [**here**](README.md).
## What is Supertramp?
[Supertramp](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3JsMj0DEzyWc0VDlHuy9Bx) is [Supertramp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertramp). There you go. 
## How I got into Supertramp
Essentially my older sister visited me last year and told me to listen to [_Breakfast in America_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82AA8OeSnxI&t=789s). I then went and found it on Spotify and listened to it. I remember realizing I had definately heard some of the songs before. Songs like "Goodbye Stranger" and "The Logical Song". It was a pretty solid album. I listened to it again, it was better a second time. Then I listened to it a third time,a fourth, a fifth, and so on. I listened to it non-stop for two weeks straight. It was all I listened to on spotify for those two weeks. The music was so ingrained into my very action thoese two weeks that listening to the album transports me back to that time, the smells, the air, emotions, and all that. It was just so different from anyhing I had listened to before. It is beautiful. They were my top artist for last year and had all the top spots in my top songs. I then did not listen to it until I think July 7th. From Fall 2019 to July 7th I had started a new relationship, supported it through quarantine, met her family twice, talked to her everyday on HP, and did everything I could to make what was becoming of 2020 manageable and enjoyable for us. I then got broken up with from out of nowhere. I was with my Father and Sister in MN when it happened. It was nice to have family around. A bit later in the day my dad starts to play _Breakfast in America_ and it was just a part of what I needed. I let me relive the time before COVID and this now defunct relationship. It transpsorted me to another time and that is where I wanted to go. Music has that ability. I know that what happened was probably for the best but the way it happened was to my detriment. It was after this that I actually started to listen to their other albums:
* [_Crime of the Century_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IccIn770nJM)
* [_Crisis? What Crisis?_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS6qxgU5Xis)
* [_Even in the Quietest Moments_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EOT5nWSUSY)

These really helped me escape from the situation. Also from the end of August to Nov. 3rd I listened to no other album but _Breakfast in America_ again, this breaking my record of 2 weeks. I probably have a total listening time of at least 5 days with that album. Anyway I love them and their music.

<h1 style="font-family:Verdana;">The Logical Song</h1>
<pre style="font-family:Times New Roman;">   This is one of my favorite songs on the album <i>Breakfast in America</i>!
I love the lyrical theme of social programing through education. The lyrics feel
relatable to me.The lyrics, "Please tell me who I am" are especialy relevant in 
todays society where it seems, at least to me, that social media platforms
bombard developing minds with what to think, who to trust, who to hate, and not
how to think.I think the internet is great but sometimes I wish I could
experience life before it. Click the album to take a listen.</pre>
