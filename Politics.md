# Politics
  Maybe not the most fun topic for some people, but to me it is sports with actual consequences.

## Origin of Liking
  My family always had the news on once we got cable and before that local news. So growing up I guess I just had an intrest in current events and the news. General elections were always the coolest because it was essentially the SuperBowl. I barely remember 2008 and do not at all remember 2004 except for some fun political videos linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8Q-sRdV7SY) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE8V22unwRo). It was fun but also frustrating (not because **_I_** knew what was going on but because of my parents reactions. A second grader does not know why they don't like Hillary Clinton except for that she is _bad_. When they grow up then they find out why they don't like her. 
  ### 2008 Election
  Then Senator Obama was elected to the Presidency over McCain and I remeber I though Biden's name was actually Burden.
  ### 2012 Election
  This is what I call my _sister's election_ this was the one were she was heavily involved in calling for candidates even though she could not vote (it was legal back then). This was **her** election. Too bad she picked a loser. [Here](https://www.270towin.com/2012_Election/) is the electoral map.

## THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
This was **_my_** moment. This was **_MY_** election! Could I vote? NO. Did I care? NO. It was shaping up to be pretty boring and then some guy decided to talk about a wall and some law and order and really that was about it. Then he won. I called it back in July 2015 (no one cares when I tell them that though). I still cannot believe he won. If I could relive just the poltical parts from June 16th 2015 to January 21 2017 I would.

Less enthuasiasm but still engaged in the happenings. Who ever wins I wish them the best, truly!

print("I love medium rare steaks")

print("Math heavy classes should not be taught through pre-recorded lectures.")
