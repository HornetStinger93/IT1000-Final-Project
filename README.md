# IT1000-Final-Project
Final Project for IT1000
> By: _Jackson Samson_
### What is this?
> That is a good question! This is my _markdown_ site for my final project in IT1000!   
I plan on taking you through five aspects of my life. 
* [Faith](/Faith.md)
* [Politics](/Politics.md)
* [Music](Music.md)
* [Careers](Careers.md)
* [Supertramp](Supertramp.md)
> These sites will be summaries of the topic and its relation to my life. Expect to see links to relevant music on every page (_except for careers, that one may be a bit boring_).
