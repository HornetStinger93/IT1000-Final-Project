<h1 style="font-family:Verdana;">The Logical Song</h1>
<pre style="font-family:Times New Roman;">   This is one of my favorite songs on the album <i>Breakfast in America</i>!
I love the lyrical theme of social programing through education. The lyrics feel
relatable to me.The lyrics, "Please tell me who I am" are especialy relevant in 
todays society where it seems, at least to me, that social media platforms
bombard developing minds with what to think, who to trust, who to hate, and not
how to think.I think the internet is great but sometimes I wish I could
experience life before it. Click the album to take a listen.</pre>

<h2> Shape of Lyrics</h2>
<p> Here are some abstract shapes I thought of while listening to the song.</p>
