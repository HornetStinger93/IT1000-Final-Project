# MUSIC
I love music. So much so there is apage on here dedicated to one of my favorite bands. I have always loved music. I cannot remember a time when I was not making stupid melodies or rhythms. There are some aspects I will cover in this page. Click [here](/README.md) to go **home**.

## 1. My Musicality
I got my start with music in, you guessed it: [Frank Stallone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx0sVbWjMDo). It was music class. We sang songs and stuff like that. I remember we sang a creepy song about [Oliver Cromwell](https://www.oxfordlieder.co.uk/song/3289) in my 3rd Grade _Honor_ Choir. We played recorders in fourth and fifth grade, but I did not really get my start until 6th grade band. I choose to play the flute. I stand by that decision. I played it though high school and I wish I brought one with me to college. It really is a fun and beautiful instrument. I should have tried harder (I got into the top band but that was about it). Six years of muscle memory really should not go away, so I am sure I could pick it up and still play realativley well. 
#### Guitar
I picked up guitar midway through my 7th grade year. I choose the electric over the acoustic beacuse [Def Leppard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKRFWjXbR7Y) was a lot cooler on an electric than an accoustic (not that I could play Def Leppard at that time). I did not really develop my skills with guitar until late 8th grade because a lot of the songs I wanted to play were too difficult. In 8th grade I got into Nirvana, and Nirvana songs are not the hardest to play. My skills developed over time along with my musical tastes. Both getting heavier and faster. By freshman year of college I was listening to Death and playing along with it. I focused on rhythm playing not solos. Some rhythm parts may as well be solos (See: [Megadeth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pok6dO4J6dg)). I have been playing bass for our Worship team and it has been the best. Heavy Metal and Contemporary Christian music do not neccisarrily translate to each other well, so with bass I am able to pull from my pop and 70s tunes as inspiration (I throw some thrash in their every once in a while). It is so much fun. I even get to write my own parts!
#### Piano
This is relativley recent as I got a midi keyboard for Christmas last year. I wish I had started playing this before any other instrument as it has taught me the basics of a lot of music theory that I did not get from both band class and playing Heavy Metal songs. Not that those things were not based in music theory but that it is difficult to see it. I got into piano when I started listening to Supertramp, Tears for Fears, Kate Bush, etc. I love synthesizers!

Pick any of these they are 10/10s. These lists have been the hardest thing I've done this semester. 
## 3. Musical Aspirations
I would love to use this interest in music to write my own songs and albums. I enjoy writing the music part but lyrics are hard. I'd love to write for a Church and hopefully reach an audience that is not necessarily Christian. I want to make Worshipful music in lyrics and composition but also take from some of my favorite artists and throw it all together. I love music if you can't tell. 


### Because you asked...
 Here is another block of code. This is my **_turtlegraphics64_**:

``` import turtle 

  hurricane = turtle.Turtle()

  hurricane.speed(30)
  #So this makes a sorta eye looking thing which I like.

  #It makes me think of the song 1000 Eyes by Death. Terrific song btw.

  #Also for some reason reminds me of sketches of the globe on the internet from the 1990s.

  #I do not know where I get that idea from but it reminds me of it.

  #This was a fun project.

 for i in range(50):

    hurricane.pencolor("red")
    hurricane.circle(10)
    hurricane.left(45)
    
    hurricane.pencolor("green")
    hurricane.circle(20)
    hurricane.right(150)

    hurricane.pencolor("yellow")
    hurricane.circle(30)
    hurricane.right(100)

    hurricane.pencolor("blue")
    hurricane.circle(40)
    hurricane.degrees(180)

    hurricane.pencolor("black")
    hurricane.circle(50)
    hurricane.degrees(180)
    
    hurricane.penup()
    hurricane.setposition(0, 0)
    hurricane.pendown()
    
    hurricane.right(2)
    
turtle.done() 
```
